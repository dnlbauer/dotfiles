# Test Implementation

Implement or update the tests for the code changes.

## Implementing Tests

1. Check for staged changes with (`git status`).
If no changes are staged, review appropriate files.
2. Review existing unit tests for changed functionality.
3. Identify the functionality that needs testing.
4. Write new tests or update existing ones to cover the changes.
5. Ensure tests are comprehensive, covering edge cases and error handling.
6. Run the tests to verify they pass with the current code.

## Best practices

- Test folder structure should mirror the source code structure
- Write tests that cover both positive and negative cases
- Ensure tests are isolated and do not depend on external state
- Use descriptive names for test functions
- Keep tests small and focused on a single functionality
- Use fixtures or setup methods to prepare the test environment
